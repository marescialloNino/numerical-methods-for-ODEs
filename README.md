# numerical-methods-for-ODEs
Collection of scripts and solvers of ordinary differential equations

This collection comes from a homework i did in the course 'Numerical methods for differential equations'.
There is the solutions to some specific ordinary differential equations problems.
I also included the LaTex code I used to report the homework.

Method implemented: forward/backward Euler, Runge-Kutta 4 stages, Simpson's.

There is also an excersise about systems of ODEs and the solution to Lotka-Volterra Equation.
